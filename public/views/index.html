    <div class="faq">
        <div class="container">
        <h6>Why should I use Readly?</h6>
        <p>It's no question that repeated reading is the key to <a href="http://www.wired.com/medtech/health/magazine/16-05/ff_wozniak?currentPage=all">improving understanding or memorization.</a> Readly is a service that aims to help users remmeber important information by periodically reminding them about an article they've read.</p> <br>
        <h6>How is this different from Pocket or Instapaper?</h6>
        <p>While apps like Pocket and Instapaper are undoubtedly great for saving articles to read later, my experience with those apps seemed that I've never really got to reading the articles I've saved, and eventually forgot about it. Readly wishes to solve that problem by reminding the users periodically about the article.</p> <br>
        <h6>Does it cost any money?</h6>
        <p>Nope, it's completely free, and always will be.</p> <br>
        <h6>Can I register without a Twitter account?</h6>
        <p>As of now, no - however, Readly will be expanding service to other platforms such as Facebook as well. Twitter is the ultimate platform where many retweets and distribution of links and articles are happening. Don't have an account? I suggest you <a href="https://twitter.com/signup">make one</a> now!</p>
