        <p>ReadAgain is a simple, unobtrusive service that aims to remind and encourage second readings to users an interesting article they've read. <br>Just tweet a link, add a hashtag, you'll be emailed the link again soon.</p>

        <h4>Why should I use ReadAgain?</h4>
        <p>It's no question that repeated reading is the key to <a href="http://www.wired.com/medtech/health/magazine/16-05/ff_wozniak?currentPage=all">improving understanding or memorization.</a> I made ReadAgain when I thought it could help me by not only just reading-and-passing by links retweeted or I found online, but by periodically reminding myself I can memorize them.</p> <br>
        <h4>How is this different from Pocket or Instapaper?</h4>
        <p>While apps like Pocket and Instapaper are undoubtedly great for saving articles to read later, my experience with those apps seemed that I've never really got to reading the articles I've saved, and eventually forgot about it. ReadAgain wished to solve that problem by reminding the users periodically about the article.</p> <br>
        <h4>Does it cost any money?</h4>
        <p>Nope, it's completely free, and always will be.</p> <br>
        <h4>Can I register without a Twitter account?</h4>
        <p>As of now, no. Majority of retweets for useful links seems to be happening in Twitter, so it's the focus for ReadAgain for now. I might add Facebook and Pinterest integration later.</p> <br>
        <h4>What about privacy concerns?</h4>
        <p>ReadAgain doesn't collect any other information other than what's already publically available on your Twitter account.</p> <br>
        <h4>Can I give some feedback?</h4>
        <p>Sure! Drop a message on <a href="https://twitter.com/smashthewindow">Twitter</a>.</p>
