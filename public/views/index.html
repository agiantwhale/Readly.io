        <h1>Don't forget useful articles - <em>Read again.</em></h1>
        <p>ReadAgain is a simple, unobtrusive service that aims to remind and encourage second readings to users an interesting article they've read. <br>Just tweet a link, add a hashtag, you'll be emailed the link again soon.</p>

        <h4>How does this work?</h4>
        <p>Simple as explained above - you tweet about a blog post or an article you enjoyed, and we'll send you an email after the specified amount of time in the hashtag.</p> <br>
        <h4>How is this different from Pocket or Instapaper?</h4>
        <p>While apps like Pocket and Instapaper are undoubtedly great for saving articles to read later, my experience with the app seemed that I've never really got to reading the articles I've saved, and eventually forgot about it. ReadAgain wished to solve that problem by reminding the users periodically about the article.</p> <br>
        <h4>Does it cost any money?</h4>
        <p>Nope, it's completely free, and always will be.</p> <br>
        <h4>Can I register without a Twitter account?</h4>
        <p>As of now, no. Majority of retweets for useful links seems to be happening in Twitter, so it's the focus for ReadAgain for now. I might add Facebook and Pinterest integration later.</p> <br>
        <h4>What about privacy concerns?</h4>
        <p>ReadAgain doesn't collect any other information other than what's already publically available on your Twitter account.</p> <br>
        <h4>Who made this?</h4>
        <p>Nobody important. But if you're a stalker, feel free to follow me on Twitter/Facebook/Wordpress.</p> <br>
        <h4>Can I give some feedback?</h4>
        <p>Sure! Drop a message on Twitter or send an email.</p> <br>
        <h4>How about some donations?</h4>
        <p>I always need more money for RedBull/coffee/pizza. Here's my PayPal and here's my BitCoin wallet.</p> <br>
