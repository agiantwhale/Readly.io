readly.io
======

This repository contains backand and frontend code for [readly.io](http://readly.io).
The project is heavily based on the [MEAN Stack](http://mean.io).

The entire code was written under 7 days, so its documentation isn't at its best form.
Many of the commit messages was written when I had almost no sleep, so sometimes they make no sense either.
I apologize for this inconvenience.

#### Deployment
In addition to MongoDB, the project requires a redis store.
Only the development and heroku configurations are set correctly (test and production configurations have not been modified from those found in MEAN's repository).
NPM, Grunt and Bower must be installed globally.
Run command "npm install" in the cloned folder.
